            <div class="discovery-description">Demonstrated that the quantum constraint algebra of Loop Quantum Gravity closes without anomalies when properly regularized using the Thiemann regularization procedure. The proof establishes that the quantum analogs of the Hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraints satisfy the same algebra as their classical counterparts, up to operator ordering ambiguities that vanish in the semiclassical limit. This result is crucial for the physical consistency of the theory.</div>

The solution preserves causal structure within the bubble while permitting effective faster-than-light motion relative to external observers.</div>
