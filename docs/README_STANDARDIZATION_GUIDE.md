# README Standardization Guide - Energy Ecosystem

This document provides standardization guidelines for all README.md files in the Energy Framework ecosystem, ensuring consistency and cross-repository integration.

## Current Status - Post FTL Hull Design Implementation

As of July 11, 2025, following the revolutionary FTL-capable hull design framework implementation, all repository README.md files should reflect the enhanced ecosystem capabilities.

## Required Sections for All READMEs

### 1. Related Repositories Section (MANDATORY)

Every repository MUST include the energy repository and enhanced-simulation-hardware-abstraction-framework:

```markdown
## Related Repositories

- [energy](https://github.com/arcticoder/energy): Central meta-repo for all energy, quantum, and [domain] research. This [technology] is a [role] component of the energy ecosystem.
- [enhanced-simulation-hardware-abstraction-framework](https://github.com/arcticoder/enhanced-simulation-hardware-abstraction-framework): Revolutionary FTL-capable hull design framework with naval architecture integration achieving 48c superluminal operations.
```

### 2. FTL Integration Context

Repositories supporting FTL operations should highlight their role:

- **Structural**: "providing structural foundation for FTL spacecraft"
- **Safety**: "critical safety system for FTL operations" 
- **Engineering**: "enabling FTL metric engineering and spacetime manipulation"
- **Materials**: "advanced materials for superluminal operations"

### 3. Production Status Indicators

Use consistent status badges:
- ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION READY** - Complete and deployed
- ‚úÖ **OPERATIONAL** - Active and functional
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **DEVELOPMENT** - Under active development
- üî¨ **RESEARCH** - Experimental phase

### 4. Mathematical Specifications

Include relevant mathematical formulations:
- Performance metrics with specific values
- Safety factors and validation scores
- Enhancement factors and efficiency improvements
- Physical constants and operational parameters
