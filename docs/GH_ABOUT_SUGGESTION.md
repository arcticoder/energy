Suggested short and long descriptions for the repository `energy` (conservative, research-stage wording).

Suggested short description (one line for GitHub 'About'):

"Research-stage tools and reproducible artifacts for Loop Quantum Gravity and energy modeling â€” model-derived results, not production-ready."

Suggested longer description (paste into repository 'About' or README summary):

"This repository contains research code, simulation workflows, and reproducibility artifacts related to energy modeling and Loop Quantum Gravity experiments. Reported numbers and examples are model-derived under specific assumptions; please consult `docs/benchmarks.md`, `docs/UQ-notes.md`, and the tests in `tests/` for details on how results were produced and their associated uncertainty. For public summaries, use cautious phrasing and link to reproducibility artifacts."

Notes:
- Do not present numerical results in the short description. Link to documentation for details.
- If you want, maintainers can copy the one-line suggestion into the repository 'About' box on GitHub or use the longer description for the README summary.
