**Concern ID**: UQ-MATERIALS-001  
**Priority**: HIGHEST  
**Repository**: `enhanced-simulation-hardware-abstraction-framework`  
**Status**: ⚠️ **MISSING** - Required for hull design

**Description**: 
The FTL-capable hull design requires advanced materials with:
- Ultimate tensile strength (UTS) ≥ 50 GPa
- Young's modulus ≥ 1 TPa  
- Vickers hardness ≥ 20-30 GPa

**Current Gap**: No material characterization framework exists for:
- Plate-nanolattices (640% strength improvement over bulk diamond)
- Optimized carbon nanolattices (118% strength boost)
- Graphene metamaterials (theoretical 130 GPa tensile strength)

**Resolution Required**: Complete material simulation and testing framework

### 2. **CRITICAL**: Tidal Force Analysis at 48c Velocity
**Concern ID**: UQ-TIDAL-001  
**Priority**: HIGHEST  
**Repository**: `enhanced-simulation-hardware-abstraction-framework`  
**Status**: ⚠️ **MISSING** - Critical safety concern

**Description**: 
Tidal forces at 48c velocity create extreme stress on hull structures that could exceed material limits and cause catastrophic failure.

**Physics**: At 48c, differential gravitational effects and spacetime curvature gradients create:
- Non-uniform acceleration across vessel length
- Stress concentrations at structural joints
- Dynamic loading during course corrections

**Resolution Required**: Complete tidal force modeling and structural response analysis

### 3. **HIGH**: Multi-Physics Coupling for Hull Stress
**Concern ID**: UQ-COUPLING-001  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Repository**: `enhanced-simulation-hardware-abstraction-framework`  
**Status**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - SIF analysis exists but hull-specific validation needed

**Description**: 
While Structural Integrity Field (SIF) analysis has been completed with 242M× energy reduction, hull-specific stress propagation analysis is required for:
- Electromagnetic field interactions with hull materials
- Thermal stress from warp field energy densities
- Mechanical stress from 48c acceleration profiles
- Quantum field effects on material bonds

**Resolution Required**: Hull-specific multi-physics coupling validation

### 4. **HIGH**: Manufacturing Feasibility Assessment
**Concern ID**: UQ-MANUFACTURING-001  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Repository**: `enhanced-simulation-hardware-abstraction-framework`  
**Status**: ⚠️ **MISSING** - Production readiness unknown

**Description**: 
Advanced nanolattice materials require specialized manufacturing processes:
- 300 nm strut fabrication for sp²-rich carbon architectures
- Defect-free assembly of graphene metamaterials
- Quality control for medical-grade hull components
- Scale-up to vessel-sized structures

**Resolution Required**: Manufacturing process simulation and validation

### 5. **MEDIUM**: Hull-Warp Field Integration
**Concern ID**: UQ-INTEGRATION-001  
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Repository**: `enhanced-simulation-hardware-abstraction-framework`  
**Status**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Field control exists but hull integration unvalidated

**Description**: 
Hull structure must integrate with:
- LQG polymer field generators
- Structural Integrity Fields (SIF)
- Medical-grade safety systems
- Emergency deceleration protocols

**Resolution Required**: Complete hull-field integration analysis
