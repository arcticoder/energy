# Progress Log

## 2025-08-01

### Repository Status
- Energy research framework configured; future directions defined in `future-directions.md`.

### Completed to Date
- AI-driven tokamak vacuum design system prototype integrated and validated (Q-factor 49.3).
- FTL optimization proof-of-concept demonstrating 863.9× energy factor delivered.
- Medical-grade graviton safety modules implemented with 10¹²× protection margin.

### In Progress
- Simulations for multi-tokamak array scaling and synchronization.
- Hardware-in-the-loop integration tests for quantum field manipulation systems.

### Next Tasks
1. Develop Python simulation module for multi-tokamak array coordination (section 1.2).
2. Write unit tests (pytest) for gravitational controller stability under dynamic loads.
3. Implement data analysis scripts for FTL drive energy profiles and generate benchmark plots.
4. Set up CI workflow to run simulation demos and validate future-direction milestones.
