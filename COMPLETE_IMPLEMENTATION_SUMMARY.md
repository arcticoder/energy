### SU(2) ⊗ Diff(M) Algebra Implementation

#### SU(2) Gauge Field Components
```python
# Three SU(2) generators (Pauli matrices / 2)
sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z = Pauli matrices
su2_generators = [sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z] / 2

# Field strength tensor with commutator terms
F_μν^a = ∂_μ A_ν^a - ∂_ν A_μ^a + ε^abc A_μ^b A_ν^c
```

#### Diffeomorphism Group (Diff(M))
```python
# 4D spacetime coordinate transformations
x'^μ = x^μ + ε^μ(x)  # Small diffeomorphism

# Metric transformation preserving light cone
g'_μν = (∂x^α/∂x'^μ)(∂x^β/∂x'^ν) g_αβ
```

#### UV-Finite Graviton Propagators
```python
# Polymer-enhanced propagator
if k < uv_cutoff:
    sinc_factor = sinc(μ_gravity * k / π)²
    propagator = sinc_factor / k²
else:
    propagator = (uv_cutoff / k)⁴ / k²
```
