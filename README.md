## Documentation Index & Priority System

This repository includes a comprehensive **documentation index** (`documentation-index.ndjson`) that serves as a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system for all documentation across the 35+ repositories.

### Document Priority Classification

The index assigns priority levels to documents based on their **research criticality** and **implementation impact**:

- **HIGH Priority**: Core theoretical frameworks, critical physics derivations, fundamental mathematical foundations
  - Examples: Einstein field equations, LQG technical documentation, exotic matter analysis
  - **Impact**: Essential for understanding and validating breakthrough physics
  
- **MEDIUM Priority**: Supporting analysis, numerical methods, validation frameworks, implementation details
  - Examples: Solver documentation, parameter constraints, uncertainty tracking
  - **Impact**: Important for practical implementation and verification
  
- **LOW Priority**: Examples, test cases, basic documentation, tutorial materials
  - Examples: Harmonic cavity tests, mock data generation, simple examples
  - **Impact**: Useful for learning and development but not critical to core physics

### Documentation Categories Indexed

- **Technical Documentation** (`.md` files): Framework overviews and implementation guides
- **Mathematical Derivations** (`.tex` files): Rigorous mathematical foundations and proofs
- **Uncertainty Tracking** (`UQ-TODO.ndjson` files): Quality assurance and validation concerns
- **Code Examples** (`.am` files): Computational implementations and test cases
- **Data Files** (`.ndjson` files): Reference solutions and configuration data

The priority system enables researchers to quickly identify the most critical documents for understanding breakthrough physics while ensuring comprehensive coverage of all supporting materials.
