## Documentation Index & Priority System

This repository includes a comprehensive **documentation index** (`documentation-index.ndjson`) that serves as a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system for all documentation across the 35+ repositories.

### Document Priority Classification

The index assigns priority levels to documents based on their **research criticality** and **implementation impact**:

- **HIGH Priority**: Core theoretical frameworks, critical physics derivations, fundamental mathematical foundations
  - Examples: Einstein field equations, LQG technical documentation, exotic matter analysis
  - **Impact**: Essential for understanding and validating breakthrough physics
  
- **MEDIUM Priority**: Supporting analysis, numerical methods, validation frameworks, implementation details
  - Examples: Solver documentation, parameter constraints, uncertainty tracking
  - **Impact**: Important for practical implementation and verification
  
- **LOW Priority**: Examples, test cases, basic documentation, tutorial materials
  - Examples: Harmonic cavity tests, mock data generation, simple examples
  - **Impact**: Useful for learning and development but not critical to core physics

### Documentation Categories Indexed

- **Technical Documentation** (`.md` files): Framework overviews and implementation guides
- **Mathematical Derivations** (`.tex` files): Rigorous mathematical foundations and proofs
- **Uncertainty Tracking** (`UQ-TODO.ndjson` files): Quality assurance and validation concerns
- **Code Examples** (`.am` files): Computational implementations and test cases
- **Data Files** (`.ndjson` files): Reference solutions and configuration data

The priority system enables researchers to quickly identify the most critical documents for understanding breakthrough physics while ensuring comprehensive coverage of all supporting materials.

## Research Highlights DAG

The `highlights-dag.ndjson` file contains a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of major research discoveries, breakthroughs, and milestones. Each node represents a significant achievement with the following structure:

### Node Properties
- **id**: Unique identifier for the discovery/breakthrough
- **type**: Category (discovery, breakthrough, proof, framework, analysis, methodology, milestone)
- **title**: Human-readable name of the achievement
- **description**: Detailed description of the discovery/breakthrough
- **source_files**: Array of documentation files from `documentation-index.ndjson`
- **significance**: Impact level (critical, revolutionary, major, fundamental)
- **date**: Time period when the achievement occurred
- **predecessors**: Array of dependency IDs (what enabled this discovery)
- **successors**: Array of dependent IDs (what this discovery enabled)
- **impact**: Description of the broader impact and implications

### Key Research Pathways

The DAG traces several major research pathways:

1. **Foundation ‚Üí Applications**: `lqg_foundations` ‚Üí `constraint_algebra` ‚Üí (`warp_bubble_proof`, `anec_framework`)
2. **Energy Enhancement**: `quantum_geometry_catalysis` ‚Üí `polymer_fusion` ‚Üí `energy_enhancement`
3. **Warp Drive Development**: `warp_bubble_proof` ‚Üí `warp_drive_feasibility` ‚Üí `warp_optimization`
4. **Vacuum Engineering**: `anec_framework` ‚Üí `qi_bound_modification` ‚Üí `vacuum_engineering`
5. **Implementation**: All major streams converge to `practical_implementation`

### Significance Levels
